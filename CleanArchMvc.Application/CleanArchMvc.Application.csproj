<!--
  This project refers to the application layer. It will function as an abstraction
  layer service to provide the communication methods to the other layers.
  
  Here are defined the business rules of the application, DTO's, the services and 
  mappings of the objects.
  
  Accessing Entities directly is not advised, so DTO's are used. To map the DTO with 
  entities and vice versa AutoMapper is used.
